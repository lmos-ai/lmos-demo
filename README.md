# LMOS demo

A LMOS demo using GitHub Codespaces / Development Containers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed and running on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Using the Development Container

### Step 1: Open the Repository in a Dev Container

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/lmos-ai/lmos-demo.git
    cd lmos-demo

2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code:

3. Open the Command Palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P) and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`. This will build and open the repository in a Docker-based development container, in which Minikube is already installed and started.

### Step 2: Set OpenAI Connection Details

Once inside the development container, set up the necessary environment variables for OpenAI API access in the `.env` file.
This OpenAPI access is used by the `lmos-runtime` and the agents.

```
OPENAI_APIKEY="<your-openai-api-key>"
OPENAI_CLIENTNAME="azure"
OPENAI_MODELNAME="gpt-4o-mini"
OPENAI_URL="https://api.openai.com"
```

### Step 3: Install LMOS

Run the following commands to install LMOS onto Minikube:

```shell
./install.sh
```

### Step 3: Check the Setup

To verify the installation of LMOS, run:

```
kubectl get pods
```

Output:

```
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
arc-view-runtime-web-db8d87c59-54k7b   2/2     Running   0          87s
lmos-operator-64bfb9b569-4l9qv         2/2     Running   0          2m22s
lmos-runtime-59ffdbdc6f-v5jtr          2/2     Running   0          2m21s
```

The status has to be `2/2 Running` for all three of them.

### Step 4: Access Kiali and Grafana

To visualize your setup, various ports have been forwarded for LMOS, Kiali, Prometheus and Grafana. You can access these tools at

- Kiali: http://localhost:20001
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

The LMOS components can be accessed at:
- Arc View: http://localhost:8080 (Web)
- LMOS Runtime: http://localhost:8081 (API)

### Step 5: Install a demo

In the `demos` folder, you can find various demo setups.
To install a demo, run the corresponding `install.sh` script, e.g. for the `starter` demo:

```shell
./demos/starter/install.sh
```

## Using ArgoCD for deployment

You can add the `argocd-apps` folder as new ArgoCD application to your existing cluster ArgoCD managed cluster. You only need to adapt the secrets.yaml.
